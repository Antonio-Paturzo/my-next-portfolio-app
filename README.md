## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project! In this README file, I will take you through my journey from the beginning to the end of this project. I'll share the technologies I used, including Next.js, Sanity CMS, Vercel, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, and explain how each one played a vital role in the development process.

## Starting Point

At the beginning of this project, I wanted to create a portfolio website that showcases my skills and projects effectively. After considering various options, I decided to use Next.js as the foundation for my website due to its excellent performance, server-side rendering capabilities, and seamless integration with React.

## Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. It provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box, which greatly improves the website's performance and SEO. With Next.js, I was able to create dynamic and responsive pages while maintaining optimal performance.

## Design and Content Management

Once I had the basic structure of my website set up, I wanted an easy way to manage and update the content without having to modify the code every time. This is where Sanity CMS came into play.

## Sanity CMS

Sanity CMS is a headless content management system that allows me to manage my website's content separately from the frontend. I integrated Sanity CMS into my project, enabling me to add, edit, and organize content using an intuitive interface. This separation of content and presentation made it convenient for me to update my portfolio with new projects and other information.

## Styling and UI Development

To make my portfolio visually appealing and user-friendly, I needed a reliable styling solution. Tailwind CSS provided me with a flexible and utility-first approach to CSS.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to rapidly build custom designs without writing custom CSS. Its extensive set of pre-built utility classes and responsive design options made it easier for me to style my components and create consistent UI throughout the website. By leveraging Tailwind CSS, I saved a significant amount of development time and achieved a visually cohesive and modern design for my portfolio.

## Building and Deployment

With the design, content management, and styling aspects in place, it was time to deploy my portfolio website and make it accessible to the world. Vercel provided a seamless deployment experience and optimized hosting for Next.js applications.

## Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It integrates seamlessly with Next.js, allowing for easy deployment and continuous integration. With Vercel, I could deploy my website with a simple push to a Git repository. The platform also provided features such as automatic SSL, global CDN, and instant cache invalidation, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of my portfolio to users worldwide.

## Development Process and Language

Throughout the project, I wanted to ensure code maintainability and type safety. This led me to choose TypeScript as my primary programming language.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that offers type checking and compile-time error detection. By using TypeScript, I could catch potential bugs and enforce better code quality, resulting in a more robust and maintainable codebase. The strong typing system of TypeScript also facilitated the integration of external libraries and reduced the likelihood of runtime errors.

## Conclusion

My portfolio project has been an incredible journey, from the initial design and structure to the seamless deployment. Next.js, Sanity CMS, Vercel, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript were the key technologies that played crucial roles in making this project a success. Next.js provided a solid foundation with server-side rendering, Sanity CMS enabled efficient content management, Tailwind CSS streamlined the styling process, Vercel handled deployment seamlessly, and TypeScript ensured code maintainability and type safety.

I'm proud of the result and excited to share my portfolio with the world. This project has not only allowed me to showcase my skills but also provided me with valuable experience in working with modern web development tools and technologies.

## Configuration

First, install the dependencies && check for any non-breaking changes:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the startup server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` or any of the component files. The page auto-updates as you edit and save.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Comfortaa, a custom Google Font.
